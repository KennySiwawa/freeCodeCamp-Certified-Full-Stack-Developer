ðŸš€ My freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Journey

Welcome to the documentation of my journey through the freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum!
This repository tracks my growth as I build projects, solve coding challenges, and earn certifications across multiple tech domains.

Each major section of the curriculum is organized into its own folder, showcasing the projects and skills mastered along the way.




ðŸ“š Certification Pathway

Hereâ€™s the roadmap I'm following:

    -> Responsive Web Design

    -> JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

    -> Front End Development Libraries

    -> Back End Development and APIs

    -> Quality Assurance

    -> Scientific Computing with Python

    -> Data Analysis with Python

    -> Information Security

    -> Machine Learning with Python

Every certification includes a series of hands-on projects and tests designed to apply real-world skills and build a strong, practical portfolio.

ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™ll be updating this repository consistently as I progress â€” stay tuned for more!

Feel free to explore, review my projects, and follow my growth. ðŸš€
